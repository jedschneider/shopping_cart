# Simple Shopping Cart

This is a simple example application using coffeescript and backbone.js, it was built to guide some  specific work for MUSC but is general enough for others getting started.

Most notably, this was a little project started with the skeleton app from the [Instant Coffee](https://github.com/jedschneider/instant-coffee) project. It has no testing and I feel dirty for saying that.

## Running the Code
